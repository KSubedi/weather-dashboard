# Weather Dashboard

This was a simple project I did to learn ReactJS and Redux. It is a web based dashboard that will allow you to see a 5 day average weather of different cities in one page, with charts and other things.

The easiest way to run it is to use `SimpleHTTPServer` with python.
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

This was just a learning project and is not meant to be used for anything serious.
